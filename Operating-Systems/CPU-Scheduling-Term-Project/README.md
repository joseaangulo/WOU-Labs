# CPU Scheduling Term Project

In a team of 2 Natalie and I developed a simulation of a CPU scheduler. We included the scheduling algorithms shortest job first, first in first out, and round robin. By making this application I developed more experience following SOLID principles to allow for modification and extension. I also got a deeper understanding of the operating system and the way tasks are handled by our CPU for future software development.
